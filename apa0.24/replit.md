## Technical Notes

The application uses a modular architecture that separates concerns:
- Data handling is isolated in the DataProcessor class
- Optimization logic is contained in the GRASPOptimizer class
- The main application handles user interface and orchestration

The system is designed to handle breeding optimization problems where the goal is to minimize coancestry coefficients between offspring by optimally assigning males to females in breeding programs.
